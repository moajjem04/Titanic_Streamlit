[RMS Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic) was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking at the time one of the deadliest of a single ship and the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship to date.
Based on this, in 1997, an American epic romance and disaster film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. The film named [Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)) incorporated both historical and fictionalized aspects as it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.
